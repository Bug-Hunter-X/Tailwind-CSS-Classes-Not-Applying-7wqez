# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to HTML elements despite seemingly correct usage and configuration.

## Problem Description

The problem lies in the unexpected behavior where Tailwind CSS classes are defined correctly, yet they are not applied to the HTML elements.  This can be caused by several reasons, including issues with build processes, typos in class names, missing or incorrect configuration in `tailwind.config.js`, or conflicts with other CSS frameworks or styles.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
3. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the development server, then open bug.html in the browser.

## Solution

The solution involves checking multiple potential problems:

- **Verify `tailwind.config.js`:** This file should correctly define the paths to your CSS files and any necessary configurations.
- **Inspect CSS File:** The generated CSS file should contain the relevant styles, indicating whether the issue is related to the generated code or the usage of the classes.
- **Check for Typos:** A minor typo can disrupt Tailwind's class application.
- **Ensure correct HTML structure:** Verify that the HTML structure does not interfere with the class application.
- **Check build process:** For complex projects, the build process might not correctly include the generated CSS.
- **Browser Caching:** Clear browser cache to make sure to always use the latest styles.
- **Conflict with Other CSS:** Check for conflicts with other CSS frameworks or styles.
