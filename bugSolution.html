The issue is resolved by ensuring that the `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured and that the Tailwind directives are correctly included in the HTML file.  Additionally, any potential conflicts with other CSS frameworks need to be addressed.  The correct solution involves checking all potential sources of error.
