The following Tailwind CSS classes were not applied correctly to my HTML element. I've double-checked the spelling and ensured that the classes exist in my `tailwind.config.js` file, but the styles are still not being applied.

```html
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  This div should have a gray background, padding, rounded corners, and a shadow.
</div>
```
